Discord-token-loggers
Discord token loggers for both Windows and Mac OS X

These two scripts do what you'd expect: One logs discord tokens on Windows, and one logs tokens on Mac OS X.

Both scripts are based around the same idea:

Check through application files for discord oauth tokens
Validate said tokens
Send validated tokens to a discord webhook
Idk what else to say, they're pretty basic...
